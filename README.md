# Pro_Skeleton
A small tool develop by OpenCV
/*
  Platform: VS2017 community + OpenCV3.2, a console program.
  function: use mouse to draw points and lines, then you can draft the point you like to adjust the location of the whole skeleton.
  input: path of image(of course there are some instructions when you run de program).
  operation:
    trackbar:0  In this status, you can draw points(can be draft) by clicking the left mouse button;
    trackbar:1  In this status, you can draft points(cannot be drawed of course) by clicking the right mouse button and move the mouse   untile you find the propriate location.
  output: An image which has been modified (of course you can choose do not save the changes)(the default savePath is D:\project\outPut\.jpg) in my computer.
  
  An brief instruction: This program is just a console program and it just uses some basic OpenCV GUI togather with some algorithms
  which are complex a little more. The usage of this program is to imitate the skeleton of a person by some lines and points.
